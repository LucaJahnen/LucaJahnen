# Hi, I'm Luca
I'm currently building different challenges provided by [frontendmentor](frontendmentor.io) and [TheOdinProject](theodinproject.com). After getting started in Web Develeopment using basic HTML, CSS and JS and mastering those (programming) languages I now want to deep dive into ReactJs and finally learn NextJs to build Fullstack Web Apps. Along the way, I also used some Content-Management-Systems like Wordpress or Webflow which I used to build my first real application. It took quite a while to become used to those kind of technologies but I think they do deserve a kind of attention because they have their use cases as well.

## Activity
For the last years I was quite inactive but now I want to be really focused about my learning path to finally become a decent programmer. To motivate myself I decided to use this banner:
